# Camera Archiver - Agent Guidelines and Best Practices

## Overview

This document outlines the best practices and guidelines for agents working with the Camera Archiver system. It covers development, testing, deployment, and maintenance procedures to ensure the system remains reliable, secure, and maintainable.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Structure and Organization

1. **Modular Architecture**
   - Maintain clear separation of concerns between components
   - Each class should have a single, well-defined responsibility
   - Avoid circular dependencies between modules
   - Keep functions and methods focused on a single task

2. **Type Hints and Documentation**
   - Use strict type hints for all function parameters and return values
   - Document all public methods and classes with comprehensive docstrings
   - Include examples in docstrings for complex functionality
   - Use consistent naming conventions (snake_case for variables, PascalCase for classes)

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement comprehensive error handling at all levels
   - Use specific exception types rather than generic ones
   - Ensure resources are properly cleaned up in error cases
   - Log errors with sufficient context for debugging

4. **Thread Safety**
   - Use locks when accessing shared resources across threads
   - Avoid global mutable state when possible
   - Ensure all public methods are thread-safe
   - Test concurrent access patterns

### Component-Specific Guidelines

#### Config Class

- Validate all configuration values during initialization
- Provide clear error messages for invalid configurations
- Use immutable objects where possible
- Document all configuration options with examples

#### FileDiscovery Class

- Handle various directory structures gracefully
- Implement robust timestamp parsing with clear error messages
- Use efficient file system traversal methods
- Consider performance when scanning large directory trees

#### FileManager Class

- Implement atomic file operations where possible
- Handle file system errors gracefully
- Use appropriate permissions for created files and directories
- Ensure trash destinations don't conflict with existing files

#### Transcoder Class

- Validate all inputs before executing external processes
- Implement proper resource cleanup for subprocesses
- Handle various ffmpeg output formats
- Monitor transcoding progress accurately

#### FileProcessor Class

- Generate clear, verifiable action plans
- Execute operations in a logical sequence
- Handle partial failures gracefully
- Maintain state consistency throughout operations

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

1. **Test Organization**
   - Organize tests by component, with separate test classes for each
   - Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
   - Group related tests using pytest markers
   - Implement fixtures for common test scenarios
   - Explicitly do NOT use `unittest`, instead rely on `pytest` and `pytest-mock` facilities for testing, patching, and mocking
   - When `MagicMock` would be required for typing use `pytest_mock.MockerFixture` from `pytest-mock` instead
   - Leverage `pytest` parametrization to reduce boilerplate when dealing with tests that cover similar cases
   - When a test's name would shadow or be substantially similar to another existing test concisely rename it based on what it actually is testing rather than whatever function name is being tested
   - In the event two tests reside in different test category files and are substantially the same one of them should be renamed based on what category of test it is (based on its implementation) and the other should be removed to address the shadowing conflict

2. **Test Coverage**
   - Aim for high test coverage (>90%) for critical components
   - Test both happy paths and error conditions
   - Include edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Test thread safety for concurrent operations

3. **Mocking and Fixtures**
   - Mock external dependencies (file system, subprocesses)
   - Use fixtures for creating consistent test environments
   - Implement realistic test data that mirrors production scenarios
   - Ensure mocks accurately represent the behavior of real dependencies

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**

   - Verify correct behavior with various inputs
   - Test error handling paths
   - Ensure proper resource cleanup

2. **Integration Tests**

   - Verify end-to-end workflows
   - Test with realistic file structures
   - Validate data flow between components

3. **Performance Tests**
   - Test with large file sets
   - Verify memory usage stays within bounds
   - Measure processing throughput
   - Identify and address performance bottlenecks

### Test Data Management

1. **Test File Creation**
   - Use fixtures to create realistic test file structures
   - Implement helper functions for creating test files with specific timestamps
   - Ensure test data is properly cleaned up after tests
   - Use temporary directories for all file operations

2. **Mocking External Processes**
   - Create realistic mocks for ffmpeg and ffprobe
   - Simulate various process behaviors (success, failure, timeout)
   - Ensure mocks accurately represent the real process outputs
   - Test with different process execution scenarios

## Deployment Guidelines
